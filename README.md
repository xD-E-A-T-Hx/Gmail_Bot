# Gmail Bot

A simple Python script which uses random proxies scrapped and check, on failing this uses free proxies and failing this will use paid proxies (none of which are supplied)
Proxy files can be populated with proxies in the format of IP:PORT


This uses sms-activate for OTP authentication.

Very much a work in progress

happy botting
